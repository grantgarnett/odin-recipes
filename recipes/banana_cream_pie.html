        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Who doesn't like bananas? You'll go
            'bananas' for this delicious banana cream
            pie recipe! Best eaten on a warm day. Enjoy!
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 1/2 cups whole milk</li>
            <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>4 large egg yolks</li>
            <li>5 tablespoons corn starch</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter, room temperature</li>
            <li>4 bananas sliced</li>
            <li>1 pie crust</li>
            <li>(optional) whipped cream, for topping</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare your pie crust. I prefer using a graham 
                cracker crust for this pie, but a regular pie 
                crust is just as delicious!</li>
            <li>Combine the milk with the sugar and salt in a 
                medium-sized pot over medium heat. Whisk until 
                the mixture is hot to touch, and the sugar has 
                completely dissolved.</li>
            <li>Whisk together the egg yolks and cornstarch.</li>
            <li>While stirring, gradually pour ~Â½ cup of the milk 
                mixture into the yolk mixture. Then, add the yolk 
                mixture to the pan with the remaining milk mixture.
            </li>
            <li>With the pan over medium heat, stir until the 
                pudding is thick and bubbly. Remove from heat 
                and whisk in the vanilla extract and softened 
                butter until it's melted and completely combined.
            </li>
            <li>Cover the top of the pudding with plastic wrap and 
                let it cool.</li>
            <li>Starting with banana slices, alternately layer the 
                banana slices and pudding over the crust.</li>
            <li>Let the pie chill for at least an hour prior to 
                serving.</li>
            <li>Serve with whipped cream (optional). Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
