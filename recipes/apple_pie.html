            it hits your plate the game is on. Spoiler alert...

        </p>

        <h2 class="header">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>8 small Granny Smith apples, or as needed</li>
            <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup packed brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup water</li>
            <li>2 nine-inch pie crusts</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="header">Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients. Preheat the oven to 425 
                degrees F (220 degrees C). Peel and core apples, 
                then thinly slice. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add 
                flour and stir to form a paste; cook until fragrant, 
                about 1 to 2 minutes. Add both sugars and water; 
                bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer 
                for 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat.</li>
            <li>Press one pastry into the bottom and up the sides of 
                a 9-inch pie pan. Roll out remaining pastry so it 
                will overhang the pie by about 1/2 inch. Cut pastry 
                into eight 1-inch strips.</li>
            <li>Place sliced apples into the bottom crust, forming a 
                slight mound. Lay four pastry strips vertically and 
                evenly spaced over apples, using longer strips in the 
                center and shorter strips at the edges.</li>
            <li>Make a lattice crust: Fold the first and third 
                strips all the way back so they're almost falling 
                off the pie. Lay one of the unused strips 
                perpendicularly over the second and fourth strips, 
                then unfold the first and third strips back into 
                their original position.</li>
            <li>Fold the second and fourth vertical strips back. 
                Lay one of the three unused strips perpendicularly 
                over top. Unfold the second and fourth strips back 
                into their original position. Repeat Steps 6 and 7 
                to weave in the last two strips of pastry. Fold 
                and trim excess dough at the edges as necessary, 
                and pinch to secure.</li>
            <li>Slowly and gently pour sugar-butter mixture over 
                lattice crust, making sure it seeps over sliced 
                apples. Brush some onto lattice, but make sure it 
                doesn't run off the sides.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce 
                the temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) 
                and continue baking until apples are soft, 35 to 
                45 minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
