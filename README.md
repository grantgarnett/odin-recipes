# odin-recipes

This is a Recipe Book project completed as a part
of The Odin Project's curriculum. As the title
implies, in this project we will have a number of
html pages corresponding to different recipes!

We will be demonstrating a basic familiarity of html
and git, incorporating the latter into
our workflow through a series of commits.
